# Analyze and Visualize Sentiment Patterns in Social Media Data

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By leveraging various data analysis techniques, we can gain insights into the distribution of sentiments, common words associated with each sentiment, and text characteristics like sentence and character counts.

## Project Structure

- **Dataset**: [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis)
- **Source Code**: The analysis and visualization are performed using Python and several data science libraries. The key tasks include:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Sentiment distribution analysis
  - Word cloud generation for different sentiments
  - Text length distribution analysis by sentiment category
  - Most common words analysis in each sentiment category
  - Sentence and character count distribution analysis

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- nltk
- wordcloud
- PIL (Pillow)
- BeautifulSoup4
- re (regular expressions)

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for your project, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Step 1: Install `virtualenv`
If you haven't installed `virtualenv` yet, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
This will create a directory named venv in your project folder.

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
```bash

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
```bash

source venv/bin/activate
Once activated, your terminal or command prompt should show the name of the virtual environment (e.g., (venv)).

### Step 4: Install Required Packages
With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy nltk wordcloud pillow beautifulsoup4
### Step 5: Download NLTK Data
Download the necessary NLTK data components:

```python

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')

### How to Run
Download the Dataset: Download the dataset from Kaggle and save it locally.

Activate the Virtual Environment: Ensure that your virtual environment is activated using the instructions in the previous section.

### Load and Clean the Data:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Clean the text data by removing HTML tags, special characters, punctuation, and stop words.
Preprocess the text for further analysis.

### Analyze Sentiment Distribution:
Visualize the distribution of different sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).
Generate Word Clouds:
Create word clouds for each sentiment category to visualize the most common words.

### Analyze Text Lengths:

Compare text lengths (character count) across different sentiment categories.
Plot the distribution of text lengths.

### Common Words Analysis:

Identify and visualize the most common words in each sentiment category.

Sentence and Character Count Distribution:
Add columns for sentence and character counts in the text data.
Plot the distribution of sentence and character counts.

### Results
The analysis provides insights into the distribution of sentiments, most frequently used words, and the characteristics of text data associated with each sentiment category. Word clouds visually highlight the dominant words, while the histograms and bar plots help to understand the text lengths and word frequencies.
